"""Second access gate, in front of the Settings page.

The app-wide `ACCESS_KEY` (`backend/middleware/access_key.py`) lets an audience
into the demo. This code keeps that same audience out of `/settings-ui`, where
the provider / HEC / guardrail credentials are edited — a deliberately separate
secret, so handing the demo key to a room does not hand over the settings page.

Hardcoded on purpose. Unlike `ACCESS_KEY`, which is per-deployment and comes
from `.env`, this value is the same on every box, so there is nothing to
provision on a new EC2 replica. It is a demo speed bump, not a security
boundary: the `/api/settings*` and `/api/hec/*` endpoints the page drives stay
reachable with the app access key alone (the chat UI needs some of them), so
the gate is on the page, not the API.
