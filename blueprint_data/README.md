# blueprint_data — synthetic knowledge + records for the NVIDIA AI Virtual Assistant blueprint

One folder per Application Theme:

- `docs/*.md` — knowledge articles the blueprint's `retrieve_knowledge` tool searches
  (keyword retrieval by default; a local embedding NIM when `BLUEPRINT_EMBED_URL` is set).
- `records.json` — the customer / patient / subscriber records `lookup_record` reads; a
  session's synthetic end-user id is bound to one record deterministically.

Everything here is SYNTHETIC demo content. No real people, accounts or medical facts
are represented, and the medical/tax/legal/financial text is general information only.
